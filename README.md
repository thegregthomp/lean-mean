lean-mean
=========

Lighter version of the MEAN stack with some extras

Simply clone directory then run "npm install" and "bower install". The basic install runs on port 3000 on localhost. In terminal, navigate to the project folder and run "node server.js". In the browser navigate to localhost:3000 and you'll see the default landing page with a working Socket.IO example running. 

Some differences from <a href="https://github.com/linnovate/mean">Linnovate's</a> stack are:

<ul>
  <li>Use of EJS for server templating/routing</li>
  <li>Use of <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular">Angular Seed</a></li>
  <li><a href = "http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a> integration setup in controllers and factories, working in demo</li>
  <li>Factory samples included</li>
  <li>Bower components folder dependency</li>
  <li>No SASS support (can easily be added, I'm a LESS guy)</li>
</ul>
